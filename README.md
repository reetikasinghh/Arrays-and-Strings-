Array Operations in C++
Aim
The aim of this C++ program is to allow users to input and display an array of marks for ten subjects. This program is designed to illustrate basic array operations and provide an understanding of how arrays work in C++.

Theory
Arrays are fundamental data structures in programming, used to store and manage collections of data of the same data type. This program demonstrates the use of arrays to collect and display marks for subjects. It also helps users understand the importance of arrays in real-world applications where managing and processing multiple values is crucial.

Algorithm
The program follows these steps:

Initialize an integer array named marks with a size of 10 to store marks for ten subjects.
Use a for loop to iterate through the array elements, prompting the user to input the marks for each subject.
Capture and store the user-entered marks in the array.
After collecting all the marks, use another for loop to display the entered marks for each subject.
Conclusion
This program serves as an introduction to arrays in C++. Understanding arrays is essential for handling various data-driven tasks. In this example, we focus on a simple use case, but the same concepts can be applied to more complex scenarios. Arrays are widely used in areas like data processing, statistics, and database management. Learning how to work with arrays is a fundamental step for any programmer.

In summary, this program showcases the significance of arrays and lays the foundation for more advanced array operations.

This enhanced README provides a more in-depth explanation of arrays, their significance in programming, and their applications beyond the program's basic use case. It helps users understand the broader context of array operations in C++.
